# To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do application for desktop, created using React.js and Vite. The app allows users to add tasks and manage them in three different sections: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done". It also provides an option to delete tasks. All tasks are stored locally on the user's device.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Task Sections**: Tasks are split into three sections:
  - **To Do**: Tasks that need to be done.
  - **Doing**: Tasks that are currently in progress.
  - **Done**: Tasks that are completed.
- **Delete Option**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks are saved in the local memory of the user's device.
